It allows estimation using either covariance-based SEM (CBSEM, such as LISREL/Lavaan), or Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM, such as SmartPLS/semPLS).\nMain features of using SEMinR:\nA natural feeling, domain-specific language to build and estimate SEMs in R\nHigh-level functions to quickly specify interactions and complicated structural models\nModular design of models that promotes reuse of model components\nEncourages best practices by use of smart defaults and warnings\nTake a look at the easy syntax and modular design:\n\n\n# Define measurements with famliar terms: reflective, composite, multi-item constructs, etc.\nmeasurements <- constructs(\n  reflective(\"Image\",       multi_items(\"IMAG\", 1:5)),\n  composite(\"Expectation\", multi_items(\"CUEX\", 1:3)),\n  composite(\"Loyalty\",     multi_items(\"CUSL\", 1:3), weights = mode_B),\n  composite(\"Complaints\",  single_item(\"CUSCO\"))\n)\n\n# Create four relationships (two regressions) in one line!\nstructure <- relationships(\n  paths(from = c(\"Image\", \"Expectation\"), to = c(\"Complaints\", \"Loyalty\"))\n)\n\n# Estimate the model using PLS estimation scheme (Consistent PLS for reflectives)\npls_model <- estimate_pls(data = mobi, measurements, structure)\n\n# Re-estimate the model as a purely reflective model using CBSEM\ncbsem_model <- estimate_cbsem(data = mobi, as.reflective(measurements), structure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
