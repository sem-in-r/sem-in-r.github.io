SEMinR v2.0 is now released, after months of hard work by our team. To ensure that most obvious issues were fixed before release, we actually soft-released and incorporated early feedback into v2.1.0, which is what you'll find on CRAN today.

We are also delighted to add a new official co-author to the project, André Calero Valdez, who has worked with his team at Aachen University to deliver model visualizations!

Here's a breakdown of many of the new features you can look forward to.

**Visualization of graphical models PLS/CBSEM:**

- New set of functions to create plots for PLS-SEM
- A simple fully customizable theme-based visualization that allows web-based ou- ut as well as publication-ready figures (supports shiny, png, svg, pdf, ps, we-  etc.)
- Same functions work for CB-SEM models, but uses semPlot under the hood
- A new plot-type to quickly view HTMT results to simplify analysis
- An interactive web-editor that allows tinkering with plots afterwards (e.g., highlighting)

**New visualization of results for PLS:**

- A new feature to plot interaction plots
- New visualization for reliability

**Added metrics for PLS models:**

- New functions for evaluating mediation: total path effects and generate co- idence intervals for indirect effects
- PLSpredict for items
- Added functions to calculate AIC and BIC
- Added Cronbach’s alpha to reliability

**New formatting of summary tables (PLS only):**

- csem/lavaan syntax imports
- Can import csem syntax for PLS estimation using csem2seminr() function
- Can provide lavaan syntax directly to estimate_cbsem() for CBSEM estimation

**Higher Order Constructs updated:**

- PLS: results of Higher Order Composite bootstrapping includes bootstrapped re- lts for outer loadings and outer weights
- CBSEM: Higher Order Reflective function now added.

Enjoy SEMinR v2 and we hope to hear your feedback!
